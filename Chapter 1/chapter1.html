    <h3>Baking Tips:</h3>
    <pre>- Before we start, note that the cookie dough requires prior chilling before shaping as the dough is slick!
        - When you remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator, the dough may be slightly crumbly. 
          Scooping and then shaping it with warm hands keeps it intact.

        <li> Whisk the dry ingredients together in a <b>large bowl</b>, this includes flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together then set aside.</li>
        <li> Then in a <b>medium bowl</b> whisk melted butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and the extra egg yolk and whisk in vanilla extract.</li>
        <li> After whisking the wet ingredients, pour in the dry ingredients and <b>mix together with a large spoon or spatula</b>. The dough will be very soft, thick and appear greasy.</li>
        <li> <b>Fold in the Chocolate chips</b>, they may not stick to the dough but do your best to combine them.</li>
        <li> Cover the dough with a plastic sling wrap and <b>chill in the refrigerator</b> for at least 2-3 hours or up to 3 days. </li>
        <li> Take the dough out and allow it to <b>soften at room temperature for 10 minutes</b>. </li>
        <li> <b>Preheat oven to 163&deg;C</b> then line your tray with parchment paper ir silicon baking mats. </li>
        <li> Use cookie scoop or table spoon to scoop the cookies, however big you prefer and roll into a ball and flatten slightly when placed on the cookie sheet with an inch space between each dough.</li>
        <li> Bake cookies for 12-13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. Larger cookies can take up to 14 minutes or longer. The center will look soft but the cookies will continue to set as they cool for 10 minutes out of the oven.</li>
        <li> After cooling,<b> transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely</b>. </li>
        <li> These cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for a week.</li>
