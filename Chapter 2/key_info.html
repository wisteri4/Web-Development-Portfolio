    <p> 
        Chicago features songs composed by John Kander and with lyrics by Fred Ebb. Most are infused with a jazzy, vaudevillian flair fitting of the musical's 1920s-jazz-age setting. Many of the Chicago songs have become iconic musical theatre classics, like "Cell Block Tango," "Razzle Dazzle," and "All That Jazz."<br> 
        The story was also adapted from a play of the same name by Maurine Dallas Watkins, a journalist who based Chicago on actual crimes she reported on at the beginning of her career.
