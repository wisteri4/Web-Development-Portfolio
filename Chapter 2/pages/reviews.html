            Seems like people toss Chicago aside when discussing best picture winners, primarily because it doesn't veer too far in between modes of settling as a classical musical or reinventing the wheel. It's stuck in the middle, with Rob Marshall putting in fine work to make the numbers snappy and visually interesting, while still not rising to the task of being anything other than a stylistic exercise. All the performances are great, and the songs are of course incredible, but Richard Gere steals the show. Utterly charming.

            I’ve never seen a movie musical this unabashedly cut back to the stage for every number, but it’s thematically justified. I think the meta also helps sell the difference between Roxie and Velma — Catherine Zeta-Jones basically pops a blood vessel in Cell Block Tango and you know what good for her.
